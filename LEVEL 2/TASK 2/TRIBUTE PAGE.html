        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
        involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known
        a
        s the <b>Missile Man of India</b> for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
        He also played a pivotal organisational,
        technical, and political role in India's

        as the 11th <b>president of India</b> in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
        then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his
        civilian life of education, writing and public service
        after a single term. He was
        a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.
        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
        apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.  Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended
        the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

        <h4>Early life and education</h4>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
        centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras
        Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
        local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
        His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited
        Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers
        and one sister in his family.  His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
        numerous properties and large tracts of land.
        Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab
        traders and local women. The family business had
        involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
        pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With
        the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune
        and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from
        the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell
        newspapers to add to the family's meager income.
